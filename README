A simple test toolbox for testing large numbers of TCP connections.

The server is based on MongooseIM TCP listener, with some simplifications.
It is just an "echo server". Clients establish connections, each connection
sending a "hey" message every minute or so.

The way to use it is:
1. Start dummysv on one EC2 instance
2. Start dummymonitor on another EC2 instance, in foreground
3. Create a launch template to start client EC2 instances, putting contents of user_data.sh as instance user data (startup code)
4. Run monmon:print() on monitor console to see what is going on
